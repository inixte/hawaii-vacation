    <p>For Mom's 50th Birthday, we all traveled to meet her and Vincent in Kona, Hawaii after they spent the week 
      before in Maui.</p>

    <p>The trip started with waking up at the crack of dawn to catch a flight to Las Vegas on two hours of sleep.
      At the Vegas airport, which is one of the only airports that still has indoor smoking areas, we took advantage of 
      David's lounge access and enjoyed some tiny plates of free food and a few 9am cocktails. Thanks babe.</p>

    <p>After a six hour flight, we arrived at the Kona airport, which is entirely outdoors. Aloha swamp ass!</p>

    <p>Mom and vincent picked us up, and after a quick drive we arrived at our gorgeous rental house wwhere we were 
      greeted by a few loitering gold dust day geckos on the front porch, and an insane ocean view.</p>

    <p>We unloaded our shit and immediately booked it to the nearest restaraunt that served alcohol, which ended up 
      having pretty good food and a great view too.</p>
